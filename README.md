Git flow (for GitHub)
=====================

An extension for Google Chrome providing some extra features for Github to prevent people from making common mistakes.

# Current features
- Remove branch prefix from PR title
- Compare Hotfixes to `master`
- Compare Features to `develop`
- Add a template for pull requests

# Contributing
As my time (and yours as well, probably) is limited, any help is appreciated! If you want to help, you can:
- Create pull requests with new features and bug fixes
- Create issues for bugs you might encounter
- Fix issues others have created
